                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p id="hey">Hey there! I’m Wendy and one of my greatest joys is food. I was raised in the Bronx with
                    family roots in the Dominican Republic. I became a registered dietitian in 2014, wanting to provide
                    quality and culturally competent nutrition care to marginalized communities. Throughout the years,
                    my love for cooking has continued to grow.</p>
